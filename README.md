# Deep-Learning-Project-Lemon_Quality_Detection
Developed a lemon quality dataset classifier incorporating cutting edge CNN architecture and image augmentation methodologies.

Lemon dataset has been prepared to investigate the possibilities to tackle the issue of fruit quality control. It contains 2.533 images (300 x 300 pixels). Lemon images are taken on a concrete surface. Dataset also includes empty images of this surface.

Dataset contains images of both bad and good quality lemons under slightly different lighting conditions (all under daylight) and sizes.
